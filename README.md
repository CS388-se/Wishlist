## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app:

The biggest challenge encountered while building the app is how opening the keyboard affects the views on the screen. As the keyboard slid up, the views were either shifted upwards or became invisible. To disable this behavior, I added the following line in the manifiest file to fix this issue: `android:windowSoftInputMode="adjustPan"`
